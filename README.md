# ScrollView Demo App

This project is a demo mobile application built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and React Native, showcasing advanced scrollable UI patterns for both horizontal and vertical lists. It is designed as a reference for developers looking to implement:

- **Horizontal and vertical scroll views** with custom card layouts
- **Parallax scrolling effects** for engaging headers
- **Collapsible sections** and animated UI components
- **Light and dark mode support**
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Android, iOS, and Web)

The app demonstrates best practices for building modern, interactive, and visually appealing scrollable interfaces in React Native.


## Features

- **Horizontal Scroll:** Horizontally scrollable list of cards with images, snapping, and smooth scrolling.
- **Vertical Scroll:** Vertically scrollable list of items, each with an image, title, and description.
- **Parallax Header:** Parallax effect for the header image using `react-native-reanimated`.
- **Collapsible Sections:** Animated expand/collapse UI for organized content.
- **Theming:** Light and dark mode support, adapting UI colors automatically.
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Android, iOS, and the web using Expo.


## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a
   - [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
   - [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)

3. Start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Resetting the Project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
